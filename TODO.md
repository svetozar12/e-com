- Implement User Service
- Implement aggregator service(currently only empty project) and add user service to it
- Think of a way to get env variables and validate them
- Think how each microservice will communicate with each other(if it will be even needed)
- Think of a solution for api gateway
- Create nx generator when the microservice design is finished
- Start with user service(which will be responsible for users and authentication) and decide where should we place authentication middlewares(gateway or in services)
