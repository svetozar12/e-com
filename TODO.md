TODO List for E-commerce Platform Project:

1. Research and Plan:

   - Study GraphQL, microservices, and Go to understand their concepts and best practices.
   - Create a detailed project plan, including the scope, architecture, and technology stack.

2. Set Up Development Environment:

   - Install Go and necessary development tools on your local machine.
   - Set up version control (e.g., Git) to track your project's progress.

3. Create Microservices:

   - Start by setting up the Product Catalog Service as a GraphQL API.
   - Implement CRUD operations for product information using Go and a suitable database.
   - Test the Product Catalog Service to ensure data retrieval works as expected.
   - Proceed to develop other microservices (Cart, Order, Payment, Inventory, Review, and Notification) using the same approach.
   - Test each microservice independently to verify their functionalities.

4. Implement Asynchronous Communication:

   - Choose an appropriate message queue or event-driven framework for inter-service communication.
   - Integrate the message queue into your microservices architecture.
   - Update the microservices to use asynchronous communication for certain tasks (e.g., order processing and notification).

5. Build Additional Features:

   - Design and implement the search functionality using GraphQL queries and appropriate data indexing.
   - Create the user wishlist feature, allowing users to save products for later.
   - Develop the recommendation functionality based on user activity and history.

6. Develop the Admin Dashboard:

   - Design the user interface for the admin dashboard.
   - Implement backend APIs to manage products, inventory, and orders from the dashboard.
   - Test the admin dashboard to ensure smooth functionality.

7. Implement Caching Mechanisms:

   - Identify hotspots in your microservices that would benefit from caching.
   - Integrate a caching solution (e.g., Redis) into your microservices.
   - Test the caching mechanisms to verify improved performance.

8. Documentation and Progress Tracking:

   - Keep a well-organized README documenting the project's architecture, setup, and usage instructions.
   - Maintain a project journal or use project management tools to track your progress and record challenges faced.

9. Testing and Bug Fixing:

   - Perform thorough testing of the entire system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
   - Identify and fix bugs and issues as they arise.

10. Deployment:

    - Set up deployment environments for staging and production.
    - Deploy your e-commerce platform to a cloud provider or server of your choice.

11. User Interface (Optional):

    - If you have frontend skills, consider creating a user interface using modern frontend technologies like React or Vue.js to interact with your GraphQL APIs.

12. Portfolio and Showcase:
    - Update your portfolio with the details of this project, including its description, technical details, and a link to the code repository.
    - Showcase your project during job interviews or on your personal website to demonstrate your skills.

Remember to continuously refactor and optimize your code as you progress. Keep learning and improving as you face challenges and work on this exciting project! Good luck!
